    <h1>Hi, I'm Ethan!</h1>
    <h2>I'm a student and full-stack developer who is passionate about designing programs that work for people.</h2>
    <p>I’m a junior at WashU majoring in computer science and minoring in psychology and human-computer interaction.</p>
    <p>Outside of my courses, I’ve been involved as an Intro to CS Section Lead TA, a full-stack developer intern for BJC Health System, a member of Active Minds, and a Chancellor’s Career Fellow. In my free time, I enjoy biking, taking care of my succulents, and spending time with nature.</p>
    <p>Here’s some of what I’ve been up to lately!</p>
